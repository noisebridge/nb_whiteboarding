1. A daily coding challenge question: Given a string that represents a file structure where directory and file names are on separate lines and where these names are indented with a tab to show which directories they are stored under, return the length of the absolute path to a file that has the most characters. For example, given `"dir1\n\tsubdir\n\t\tfile1.txt\n\tfile2.txt"`, the file structure is:
```
dir1
  subdir
    file1.txt
  file2.txt
```
And the absolute path to a file with the most characters is `"dir1/subdir/file1.txt"`
2. A daily coding challenge question that was asked in a Twitter interview: Write the most efficient data structure that stores the last N records of orders to a company that supports two operations: (1) Return the record for the ith last order and (2) add a new record for a new order.
3. [Write a post-order traversal of a binary tree using iteration](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/description/)
4. Given 100 computers that each gives you a number when you make a function call with the computer's ID, sum up the numbers.
5. CTCI concurrency problem: Given a class that has methods `method1()`, `method2()`, and `method3()`, each of these methods will be run on a separate thread. Devise a mechanism where `method2()` only starts after `method1()` is finished and `method3()` starts only after method2() is finished. ([Similar](https://www.careercup.com/question?id=4783236498587648))
6. A daily coding challenge question: You are given a stream of numbers that is too big to fit in memory. How can you select a number uniformly at random from the numbers you are given?
7. Given an array of N-1 elements where one number from 1 to N is missing, what is the missing number?
8. 17.24 Max Submatrix: Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, write code to find the submatrix with the largest possible sum. Variant discussed: submatrix is not necessarily square.
